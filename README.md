# SigmaWikiApp
Sigma wiki app is a just for fun android project. I made this using jetpack compose.  
This app contains:  
- LazyList
- Item Detail
- Navigation
- etc

### Why I made such an agony?  
I want to give the idea that:  
- A project must not be a flex nor a pride maker
- A project must be fun
- A project must sharpen our skills  
Continue making goofy flaws cause the fracture itself always has a loophole :)
